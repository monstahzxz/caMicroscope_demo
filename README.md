# Object Detection using YOLO

## Code Challenge
Using a machine learning toolkit of your choice, create a tool which identifies objects in the image, then returns positions in pixels corresponding to bounding boxes of a user-selected class of object in the image. For example, given an image with both cats and dogs, return bounding boxes for only cats.

## Solution
I have set up a solution which takes in an input image and outputs <b>bounding boxes</b> of regions of interest.

## Example (Input/Output)
* <b>Input</b>
[Input 1](https://github.com/monstahzxz/caMicroscope_demo/examples/input1.jpg)
* <b?Output</b>
[Output 1](https://github.com/monstahzxz/caMicroscope_demo/examples/output1.jpg)
